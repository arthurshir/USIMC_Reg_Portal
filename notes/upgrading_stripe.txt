Upgrading your API version may break your implementation. Be sure to read the list of changes made since your version.
You'll be able to roll back to your previous API version for the next 72 hours. Follow our upgrade guide to test the new changes.



You're upgrading to the latest API version from 2017-02-14.

Here's a few major changes that may affect you:

We introduced two new subscription states: incomplete and incomplete_expired. For more details see [our guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/lifecycle#incomplete).
Changes statement descriptor behavior for card payments
Many properties on the Account API object have been reworked.
The id field of invoice line items for subscriptions is no longer set to the subscription ID, but instead to a unique ID. The subscription ID is now contained in the subscription field and the subscription_item field contains the subscription item ID.
When creating or updating subscriptions, the default value of trial_from_plan is now false, meaning that a subscription will not automatically inherit a plan's trial_period_days. If a subscription is already trialing, switching to a new plan without specifying trial_from_plan will maintain the trial. We recommend setting an explicit trial per subscription instead of setting trials on plans.
The plan object attributes name and statement_descriptor have been deprecated. Plans are now linked to product objects by the product attribute on plans. The name and statement_descriptor attributes of the linked product are now used instead. An error is now returned if name or statement_descriptor are passed to POST /v1/plans.
Allows a new subscription's first full invoice to be on a future date, by specifying billing_cycle_anchor, with an optional proration up to that date.
Payouts were moved out of Transfers into their own resource. /v1/payouts now represents moving money from a Stripe account to a bank account or debit card, and /v1/transfers now represents Connect platforms moving money between Stripe accounts.
